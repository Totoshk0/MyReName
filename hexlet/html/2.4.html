        <p>While thousands of bands and musicians have been forced to cancel or postpone tours in
            the face of COVID-19, Steve Vai
            counts himself as one of the lucky ones – he had no live dates on the books for 2020. However, the global
            pandemic did
            throw a rather sizeable wrench into an elaborate recording project he had been planning.</p>

        <p>“I was going to be in Europe for four weeks recording my orchestra music with the Metropole Orchestra in
            Holland
            and the
            Aarhus Denmark Radio Symphony,” the guitarist says. “It was supposed to kick off the last week of May and go
            all
            the way
            through June. It’s about four hours of orchestra music that I have that I haven’t released yet. It’s been
            performed, and
            some of the compositions are orchestrations of songs like Velorum, Call It Sleep and other selections from
            my
            catalogue.
            Probably about two-thirds of it is pretty intense, complex and dense, contemporary orchestra music. That I
            had
            to
            postpone. It’s fine – it’s just what is.”</p>

        <p>Speaking from his Los Angeles home, Vai reports that the ongoing lockdown hasn’t affected his day-to-day life
            to
            any
            great extent. “I’m fortunate. I haven’t gotten sick, at least not that I know of,” he says. “For me, it’s
            relatively
            business as usual because I live in my studio anyway. I roll with the punches and I don’t even feel them as
            punches.</p>
